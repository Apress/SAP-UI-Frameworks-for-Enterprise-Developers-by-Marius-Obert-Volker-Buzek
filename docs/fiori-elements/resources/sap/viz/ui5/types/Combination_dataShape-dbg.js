	 * The chart controls in the <code>sap.viz.ui5</code> package (which were always marked as <i>experimental</i>) have been deprecated since 1.32.0.
	 * They are no longer actively developed and won't receive new features or improvements, only important bug fixes. They will only remain in the
	 * SAPUI5 distribution for backward compatibility.
	 *
	 * <b>SAP strongly recommends that existing consumers of those controls migrate to the new {@link sap.viz.ui5.controls.VizFrame VizFrame}
	 * control to benefit from new charting enhancements and timely support. </b>
	 *
	 * <b>Note</b>: As the feature set, design and API usage of VizFrame might differ from the old chart controls, make sure you evaluate it thoroughly before migration.
	 * @experimental Since version 1.7.2.
	 * Charting API is not finished yet and might change completely.
	 * @alias sap.viz.ui5.types.Combination_dataShape
