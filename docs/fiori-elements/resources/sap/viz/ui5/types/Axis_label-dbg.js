	 * The chart controls in the <code>sap.viz.ui5</code> package (which were always marked as <i>experimental</i>) have been deprecated since 1.32.0.
	 * They are no longer actively developed and won't receive new features or improvements, only important bug fixes. They will only remain in the
	 * SAPUI5 distribution for backward compatibility.
	 *
	 * <b>SAP strongly recommends that existing consumers of those controls migrate to the new {@link sap.viz.ui5.controls.VizFrame VizFrame}
	 * control to benefit from new charting enhancements and timely support. </b>
	 *
	 * <b>Note</b>: As the feature set, design and API usage of VizFrame might differ from the old chart controls, make sure you evaluate it thoroughly before migration.
	 * @experimental Since version 1.7.2.
	 * Charting API is not finished yet and might change completely.

A two-dimensional array of format strings can be entered for scatter matrix charts and multiple charts with measureNamesDimension, to apply different formats to each sub-chart. For all other chart types, the first value of the first dimension of a two-dimensional array is used as a global format string. The following characters are reserved as tokens for format code: MDYHSAmdyhsa#?%0@. The letter "u" is used at the end of a format string to format values in SI units. If the letter "u" is added to a value between 1e12 and 1e-3 before SI units are applied, the value is formatted in exponential style. The remaining syntax matches Excel format strings. The following is a simple example of a two-dimensional array for a chart with two measures: [["#,##0.00 DM;-#,##.00 DM","#,##.00;-#,##.00"]].
